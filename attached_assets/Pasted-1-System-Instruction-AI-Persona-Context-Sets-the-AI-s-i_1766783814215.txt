GOALS

Executive critical summary (300–500 words).

Write this as an internal acquisitions decision memo.

Prioritize risks, weaknesses, and decision-relevant issues over compliments.

Assume the reader has limited time and is evaluating whether to proceed.

Exactly 5 HIGHLIGHTS and exactly 5 CONCERNS (see definitions below).

Direct responses to user-defined research objectives:
${questions.map((q, i) => Objective ${i + 1}: ${q}).join('\n')}

=== HIGHLIGHTS vs CONCERNS DEFINITIONS ===

HIGHLIGHT
Moments that clearly increase audience engagement, clarity, emotional impact, or commercial/festival appeal.
For each highlight, explain WHY it works and categorize it as one of the following:
emotion, craft, clarity, or marketability.

CONCERN
Moments that clearly reduce engagement or clarity, create confusion, feel slow, undermine credibility, or hurt marketability.

Examples include (but are not limited to):
pacing drag, unclear stakes, tonal mismatch, weak performance beats, audio/visual distractions, or narrative logic gaps.

=== CONCERN REQUIREMENTS (STRICT) ===

Each concern MUST include:

A clear issue description

A clear impact explanation (explicitly state what the audience or buyer loses: attention, clarity, trust, emotional investment, or sales potential)

A severity score from 1–5 (where 3 = a meaningful problem)

At least 3 concerns MUST have severity ≥ 3

Categorize each concern as one of the following:
pacing, clarity, character, audio, visual, tone, or marketability

Include a suggested fix for each concern

Use timestamps and describe the specific moment as evidence

Do NOT soften criticism.

Avoid hedging language such as “might,” “could,” “may,” “some viewers,” or “slightly.”

Do NOT balance concerns with praise. A concern should describe only the problem and its consequences.

Write concerns as professional internal acquisitions notes, not marketing copy.

CONSTRAINTS

Respond strictly in ${langName}.

Ensure the output is structured as valid JSON only.

Return EXACTLY 5 highlights and EXACTLY 5 concerns.

Do not include any explanatory text outside the JSON structure.

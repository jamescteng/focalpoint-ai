Recommended system design: a shared “House Style” + persona-specific “Edge”

Think of tone as two layers:

House Style (global, always on): respectful, constructive, filmmaker-safe

Persona Edge (local): what makes this lens distinct (harsh vs warm vs technical)

This gives you consistency without homogenizing.

What I would change in your proposal
1) Don’t frame it as “softer across all reviewers”

Instead frame it as “respectful, constructive house style across all reviewers”.

Because “softer” implies reducing critical content. What you actually want is:

keep the honesty

remove unnecessarily sharp phrasing

reduce defensiveness

That’s different.

2) Implement it as a top-level prefix, not copied into every persona

Option 1 (shared constant) is the right choice, but I’d implement it as:

HOUSE_STYLE_SYSTEM_PREFIX (applies to all personas)

persona.systemInstruction appended after it

and/or a small “house style” block inserted into userPrompt

This prevents drift and reduces maintenance.

3) Preserve persona differentiation with bounded severity language

For the acquisitions persona, you can still keep:

severity scoring

direct impact statements

decision memo framing

But you should remove:

“do not sugarcoat”

“not to make them feel good”

Those phrases trigger defensiveness. You can get the same critical output with more professional language.

Concrete rewrite of your draft (cleaner, less “ask for confirmation,” more actionable)

Here is a version you can use internally with your dev/team. It avoids sounding like you’re asking for approval and just states the implementation plan.

Revised internal note (ready to paste)

Tone is currently controlled per persona in server/personas.ts via:

systemInstruction (persona voice / stance)

userPrompt (how to phrase criticism and structure output)

Because each persona has a distinct voice, the tone can vary sharply (e.g., acquisitions is blunt; cultural editor is gentle). To ensure the product feels consistently filmmaker-safe while preserving persona differentiation, we should introduce a shared “house style” applied to all personas.

Proposed approach: House Style + Persona Edge

Add a shared HOUSE_STYLE_GUIDELINES prefix applied to every persona.

Keep each persona’s unique lens and rubric, but constrain language to be respectful and constructive by default.

House Style rules (applies to all personas):

Use professional, constructive phrasing (“Consider…”, “It may help to…”).

State issues clearly but without dismissive or insulting language.

Frame concerns as improvement opportunities, not verdicts.

Be specific about impact and evidence; avoid absolute value judgments.

Maintain honest severity scoring when required, but express it neutrally.

Implementation (recommended):

Create a shared constant (e.g., HOUSE_STYLE_GUIDELINES) and prepend it to every persona’s systemInstruction (and optionally add a short reminder in each userPrompt).

This is cleaner and easier to maintain than editing each persona repeatedly.

What your House Style should actually say (copy/paste block)

You want it short, enforceable, and not in tension with critical rubrics.

HOUSE STYLE (applies to all personas):
- Communicate with respect and professional restraint. No insults, ridicule, or dismissive language.
- Be candid and specific: when something is a problem, state it clearly with evidence and impact.
- Phrase recommendations constructively (e.g., “Consider tightening…”, “Clarify…”, “It may help to…”).
- Avoid absolute judgments (“this is terrible,” “this fails,” “no one will care”).
- Do not moralize the filmmaker’s choices; focus on viewer experience and outcomes.
- Keep the goal: help the filmmaker make the work stronger and more legible to the intended audience.


This preserves rigor while avoiding “harshness as identity.”

Important: how to handle the Acquisitions persona without neutering it

Instead of “no-nonsense / not to make them feel good,” use:

“Direct, time-efficient decision memo style”

“Prioritize risks and decision-relevant issues”

“Use severity and impact language”

That keeps it sharp without antagonism.

Example replacement line:

“Write with professional directness and efficiency, as an internal memo. Be candid about risks and weaknesses, supported by evidence and impact.”
